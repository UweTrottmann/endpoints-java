 *   to be references throughout the class (they don't serve only as produced/consumed), they have
 *   to be named... hence no "? extends Blah"
 *   
 *   B) The bounds are enforced at compile type and that information is lost. In fact,
 *   Class&lt;?&gt;.getTypeParameters will only return "T" and not "T extends Number"
